# Machine-learning-model-to-predict-progression-of-diabetes
 we have proposed a machine learning model for  detecting diabetes and predicting the progression of diabetes in  patients through multiple daily glucose level reading of  patients 
Two machine learning models are proposed using classification algorithms for diabetes diagnosis and progression monitoring. The first model that was for diabetes diagnosis showed highest accuracy on random forest 98.05%. The other model for predicting the diabetes progression was trained on very minimal amount of data however the model was trained successfully and showed the progression of diabetes as increase, decrease or maintained output. The advantage of the models is that dataset can be explored and new parameters can be added for training. Moreover the dataset that was generated manually can also be further append easily by adding the readings. All the parameters of dataset can be monitored and itâ€™s practical to generate the dataset without much hustle.The model was trained on decision tree with an accuracy of 87%. More rigorous studies are needed to investigate techniques for the betterment the model thereby enhancing the accuracy
